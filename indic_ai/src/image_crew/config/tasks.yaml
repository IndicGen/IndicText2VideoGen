    Important Notes:

      - Include key visual elements: temple architecture (Dravidian, Nagara, Vesara), deity depictions, rituals, environment settings (time of day, weather, season), traditional attire (dhoti, angavastram, saree), festival scenes, and natural surroundings.
      - Explicitly avoid any references to Buddhism, Chinese, Zen, or Japanese temples or monks.
      - Use adjectives like "dreamy," "ethereal," "vibrant," "whimsical," "magical light," "lush environment."
      - Mention "Ghibli-style," "painterly," or "hand-drawn anime style" explicitly in the prompt to guide DALL-E.
      - Avoid hyperrealism terms like "8k," "ultra realistic," or technical photography terms.
